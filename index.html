<p>We developed our screening framework in the <em>Python</em> programming language and it can be freely downloaded using
the link above or conveniently downloaded and installed automatically, using the <em>pip</em> command. </p>

<p>It is designed to efficiently implement various screening rules without changing
the lasso path solver (e.g., scikit-learn lasso solver). 
Even though different screening rules require different 
constraints and equations, they all share common data
structures; thus, we wrap all of them into a single framework. 
An advantage of this approach is that
the lasso path solver needs to interact with only 
one abstract class for screening rules.</p>

<h3>
<a id="adascreen-structure" class="anchor" href="#adascreen-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AdaScreen Structure</h3>

<p>To systematically manage data structures involved in screening,
we divide them into <em>Globals</em> and <em>Locals</em>, 
where <em>Globals</em> refer to
variables that do not change over the lambda path (e.g., the inputs <strong>X</strong>, <strong>y</strong>, lambda_max). 
In contrast, <em>Locals</em> refer to variables that change over
the lambda path (e.g., the last regularization parameter lambda_0 or the solution beta^*(lambda_0) from the previous lambda_0). 
We maintain these data structures in the path solver, 
and call
the <em>init</em> method in the <em>ScreeningRule</em>
before entering the 
main iteration loop of our screening framework. </p>

<p>Furthermore, we designed our screening framework in such a way that
all screening rules can be derived from the abstract base class.
For example, many screening rules can be framed with a single sphere constraint, 
consisting of a center and a radius. 
In such cases, screening rules can be implemented by overloading the <em>getSphere</em> function. 
For more advanced methods, corresponding functions need to be overloaded.
Now, let us consider how AdaScreen can be instantiated under our framework.
<em>AdaScreen</em> 
maintains a list of <em>ScreeningRules</em>
itself and can return global and local half-space constraints. 
Therefore, it is easy to implement AdaScreen with any sphere and any half-space constraints.
For example, to implement AdaScreen with EDPP sphere constraint and Sasvi local half-space constraint,
we first instantiate <em>EDPP</em>, <em>Sasvi</em>, and <em>AdaScreen</em>.
Then in <em>AdaScreen</em>, we simply call <em>setSphereRule(EDPP)</em> and <em>addHalfspace(Sasvi)</em>. </p>

<a id="about-the-adascreen-screening-ensemble" class="anchor" href="#about-the-adascreen-screening-ensemble" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the AdaScreen Screening Ensemble</h3>

<p>In order to solve large-scale lasso problems,
screening algorithms have been developed
that discard features with zero coefficients
based on a computationally efficient screening rule.
Most existing screening rules were developed from
a spherical constraint and half-space constraints on the dual optimum.
However, existing rules admit at most two half-space constraints
due to the  computational cost incurred by the half-spaces,
even though additional constraints may be useful to discard more features.
In this paper, we present AdaScreen, an adaptive lasso screening rule ensemble,
which allows to combine any one sphere with multiple
half-space constraints on a dual optimal solution.
Thanks to geometrical considerations that lead to a simple closed form solution for AdaScreen,
we can incorporate a large number of half-space constraints
at small computational cost.
In our experiments, we show that
AdaScreen with multiple half-space constraints simultaneously improves screening performance and
speeds up lasso solvers.</p>
